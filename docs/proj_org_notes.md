# **Notes**

**Steps that only need to be configured once:**

-   Getting github and Rstudio talking

-   Making a personal access token (BUT this needs to be redone every 30/90 days)

**Steps that you need to do every time:**

-   Create Rproj (click "make github" option)

-   Run "usethis::use_git()", "usethis::git_default_branch_rename()", "usethis::use_github()"

-   Set up folder structure as needed
